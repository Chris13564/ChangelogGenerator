FTB Presents Direwolf20 1.12 1.4.0 to FTB Presents Direwolf20 1.13 1.4.5

Updated:
	Thermal Expansion (went from ThermalExpansion-1.12.2-5.3.7.27-universal.jar to ThermalExpansion-1.12.2-5.3.12.17-universal.jar):
		5.3.12:
			CHANGED:
				-Adjusted insertion and extraction logic from various machine tanks.
				-Potion refining now produces a bit more at each level, ending at 100 mB for level 5 and not 50.
		5.3.11:
			GENERAL:
				-Internal refactors and optimizations.

			ADDED:
				-New Augments:
					Clastic Deposition - Allows the Igneous Extruder to make sand and gravel.

				-New machine process recipes.
				-Lots of new Plugin support.

				-New Config Options:
					Energy Scale factor for Machines. It's advanced. Be real sure you know what you're doing.
					Disable Auto-Input and Auto-Output for Machines and Devices
					Decoctive Diffuser can have its range adjusted for different Potion fluids.

			CHANGED:
				-Decoctive Diffuser has had its base radius doubled.
				-Minor recipe adjustments.

			FIXED:
				-Machine recipes and JEI categories have been decoupled.
				-Minor change to Insolator OreDict logic to prevent other mods from sabotaging it.
		5.3.10:
			GENERAL:
				-Internal refactors and optimizations.

			ADDED:
				-New Machine:
					Sequential Fabricator - It's an autocrafter! :D

				-New Augments:
					Pattern Validation - Enables intelligent auto-input on the Sequential Fabricator.

					Fluidic Fabrication - Adds an internal fluid tank to the Sequential Fabricator.

					Enstabulation Apparatus - Allows for the Centrifuge to "process" Morbs.

				-New machine process recipes.
				-Plugin Support for Ice and Fire.

			CHANGED:
				-All blocks can now be filled/drained by hand, even the Fluid Transposer. Some machines may need
					to be OFF to allow for fluid to be drained.
				-Cache behavior has been changed internally, for better crossmod compatibility.
				-Comparator behavior has been improved for the Cell, Tank, and Cache.
				-Many recipes have been rebalanced. In general, dynamos and augments are all slightly cheaper.
		5.3.9:
			ADDED:
				-New Items:
					Morbs. These allow for mobs to be caught. Basic Morbs have a 25% reuse chance. Adding some
					signalum makes this 100%. (Thanks ImbaKnugel)

					Void Satchel. It's a satchel that voids things. Be careful.

			CHANGED:
				-Dusts now smelt one at a time in the Induction Smelter. Energy cost has been adjusted.
				-Satchels now transfer to inventory on sneak-click, not regular click.

			FIXED:
				-Added logic to the Arcane Ensorcellator to circumvent a miserable failing on Mojang's part.
				-Corrected a corner case where Furnace recipes were not properly retrieved.
				-Fixed a crash when locking a tank in the Fluid Allocator.
		5.3.8:
			ADDED:
				-New Augments:
					Gearworking Die - Allows the Compactor to create Gears from 4 Ingots.

					Parabolic Flux Coupling - Converts the Energetic Infuser into a wireless charger. Only Flux
						Capacitors will be charged. This is very intentional. (Thanks ImbaKnugel)

					Disjunctive Extraction - Allows the Enervation Dynamo to destroy enchanted items for RF.

				-New Item: Reservoir - It's a multi-bucket fluid "capacitor" of sorts.

				-Satchels now have filtering, auto-pickup, and inventory transfer. (Thanks ImbaKnugel)

			CHANGED:
				-Device recipes have been changed - more Iron, less Tin overall.
				-Fluid Transposer behavior has been adjusted to accommodate partial fills/drains.
				-Igneous Extruder and Glacial Precipitator have been rewritten and have new GUIs and backends.

			FIXED:
				-Charger and Transposer should no longer have "orphan" processes in some cases.

			REMOVED:
				-Substrate and Stratum augments.
