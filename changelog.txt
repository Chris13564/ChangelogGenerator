			 * Fixed feral flare lantern and dreadlamp not dropping when broken. v2.0.0-rc1

			 * Fixed tesselating crash when placing a feral flare lantern v2.0.0-rc0

			 * first release candidate, written from scratch
			 * Improved Mega Torch from first 1.14 release
			 * Added Dread Lamp
			 * Added Feral Flare Lantern (LoS feature is currently missing but will come in the next release candidate)
			 * Added Frozen Pearl (Not really that useful anymore since the lantern now removes all lights when it gets removed, but just in case)
			 * Added entity black/white listing for megatorch and dreadlamp via config
		torchmaster_1.12.2-1.8.1.81.jar:
			v1.8.1

			 * Slightly improved the Feral Flare Lantern Bounding Box
			 * Improved compatibility with Lycanites Mobs v1.8.0

			 * FIX: Fixed rendering of the dread lamp glass texture
			 * FIX: Improved compatibility with quark mobs (stonelings and frogs in particular, both should be blocked by the dread lamp)
			 * NEW: Added /torchmaster_entity_dump command. Dumps all registered entities to the log file (Registered to the game, the mega torch and dread lamp)
			 * NEW: Added /torchmaster_list_torches command. Dumps all mega torches and dread lamps of loaded dimensions to the log file
			 *  NEW: Added mega torch and dread lamp white/black listing option
			 * Format: [PREFIX][MODNAMESPACE]:[ENTITYNAME]
			 *  Valid Prefixes:
			 * +: Adds an entity to the list, effectively blocking it from being able to spawn
			 * -: Removes an entity from the list, effectively allowing it to spawn
			 *  Examples:
			 * Block Bats from spawning: +minecraft:bat
			 * Allow pigs to spawn: -minecraft:pig
			 * Block Quark Stonelings from spawning: +quark:stoneling
			 * Use the /torchmaster_entity_dump command to obtain a full list of available entities (in the game log file) v1.7.1

			 * FIX: Fixed an issue with the Feral Flare Lantern that could lead to chunk corruption when placed close to the world height limit.
			 *  NEW: Added a configuration option to limit the amount of lights a Feral Flare Lantern can place.
			 * Warning: Setting this value in conjunction with the radius and light level setting too high can still lead to chunk corruption! Dont be stupid. You dont need a light at every possible block in a chunk. v1.7.0

			 * CHANGE: The Mega Torch and Dread Lamp now work in a cube instead of a cylinder. This should make it much easier to setup torches without overlap or deadspots. The Size of the cube is Range + 1 in each direction. A range of 64 (default) will result in a cube of 129 by 129 blocks with the torch as its center.
			 * NEW [Beta]: Mega Torches can now visualize the range at which they work. Use any dye to render a visual representation of the torches working volume. Use any dye or an empty hand to disable the renderer. The renderer will also disable itself when you change dimensions or get out of viewing range.
			 * NEW: Feral Flare Lanterns can now be configured to only place lights in line of sight. Simply rightclick the lantern to open the gui. At the moment this mechanic feels a bit clunky, so there will be changes in a future release.
			 * NEW: Mega Torches should now be able to suppress those scary cave ambient sounds v1.6.4

			 * FIX: reworked torch storage system to use capabilities instead of a global file. This fixes an issue with torches not working in most modded dimensions after a restart. You might need to replace your torches and lamps for the changes to take effect. v1.6.3

			 * FIX: Moved russian language files to correct location v1.6.2

			 * Updated to latest stable MCForge Version (14.23.3.2655)
			 * FIX: Feral Flare Lantern now uses the configuration option for its tick rate
			 * FIX: Torches should no longer work across multiple world saves
			 * FIX: Added small workaround to prevent a crash during world startup on certain modpacks
			 * FIX: Improved Terrain lighter compatibility with replaceable blocks
			 * CHANGE: Removed some Logging Spam (and added more :D well, just for some errors) v1.6.1

			 * Fix Mega Torch and Dread Lamp not working (oops...) v1.6.0

			 * Add Feral Flare Lantern (Illuminates a big area with a configurable minimum light level, default 16 radius)
			 * Add Frozen Pearl (Removes nearby invisible feral flare light sources) v1.5.3

			 * Changed buildscript and configuration to be compatible with 1.12 and 1.12.1+ v1.5.2

			 * Update to forge 14.22.0.2445
			 * Marked as stable release
			 * WARNING: IF YOU UPDATE FROM 1.4.3 OR EARLIER YOU WILL NEED TO REPLACE YOUR TORCHES AND LAMPS! v1.5.1

			 * Switched torchmaster logging to debug instead of info to reduce log spam v1.5.0

			 * Added beginner tooltips to the mega torch, dread lamp and terrain lighter

	Xaero's Minimap (v1.19.1 for Minecraft 1.14.4 --> v1.19.2 for Minecraft 1.14.4):
		v1.19.2 for Minecraft 1.14.4:
			+ Added the ability to select multiple waypoints in the waypoints menu using SHIFT (to select a range) and CTRL (to select individual) keys. You can now disable/enable or delete multiple waypoints at once. Editing multiple waypoints isn't supported yet, but it's coming soon!
			* You can now deselect a waypoint in the waypoint menu by clicking on it again. Right click to deselect everything still works though.
			* Fixed the selected set in the dropdown menu not being updated after moving a waypoint between sets.
			* Fixed some modded mobs not being seen as hostile by adding another check for the sound category. Entities don't have sound categories in 1.8.9 and 1.7.10, sounds themselves have categories. This means that a mod can make a hostile mob play a non-hostile sound and vice versa (which probably happens a lot), so I decided it's better to skip this change for these MC versions.
		v1.19.2 for Minecraft 1.13.2:
			+ Added the ability to select multiple waypoints in the waypoints menu using SHIFT (to select a range) and CTRL (to select individual) keys. You can now disable/enable or delete multiple waypoints at once. Editing multiple waypoints isn't supported yet, but it's coming soon!
			* You can now deselect a waypoint in the waypoint menu by clicking on it again. Right click to deselect everything still works though.

			* Fixed waypoints list scrolling not working while dragging a waypoint.
