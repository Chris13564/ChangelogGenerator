			- New ore preference config. This is a list of mod IDs to prefer for recipe outputs from the ore dictionary, such as casting recipes.

			Material rebalancing

			- Pig-Iron now is a medium-tier material, between iron and steel, and a better handle. It's much cheaper and keeps you topped off with food now. It uses clay instead of emerald now, but more iron. Blood also is easier to get now.
			- Cactus now always returns damage when you're holding a cactus tool. It returns more damage when blocking
			- Flammable now also sets enemies on fire when you're not blocking (aka when getting hit)
			- Prismarine now always has Aquadynamic and a very minor damage buff

			- Obsidian bolts head no head-texture
			- Fix tooltips on the materials when inspecting bolts
			- Fix snow setting on slime fluid (or rather, slime fluid being counted as solid)
			- Fixed a hit (sound) issue with projectiles stuck in blocks
			- Many small code, localization and visual fixes
		TConstruct-1.12-2.8.1.49.jar:

		UniDict-1.12.2-1.8.jar:
			New:

			 * added Black List for Entries/Kinds for KeepOneEntry. 
			 * added support for the machine "Assembler" in Extreme Energy Integration. 
		UniDict-1.12.2-1.9.jar:
			New: added an option to turn the Kind Blacklists in Whitelists as requested on [Issue#49](https://github.com/WanionCane/UniDict/issues/49)

			Warning: due to Tinker's Construct changes, UniDict needs to override the setting "S:orePreference" from tconstruct.cfg in order to make the "Indirect Integration" to work, this is likely to be temporary. fixes [Issue#59](https://github.com/WanionCane/UniDict/issues/59)
		UniDict-1.12.2-1.9b.jar:
			Fixed: Keep One Entry Blacksets/Whitesets.
		UniDict-1.12.2-2.0.jar:
			CraftTweaker support:
			mods.unidict.api.newShapedRecipeTemplate(String outputKind, int outputSize, String[][] shape); mods.unidict.api.newShapelessRecipeTemplate(String outpuKind, int outputSize, String[] inputs); mods.unidict.removalByKind.crafting(String kindName); 
			the first two commands are for creating all the recipes for a given kind, per example, if you want change all you gear recipe to have a different shape, then now you don't need to create one by one.
			the last command will be used to remove recipes for a given kind, if you pass it the argument "block", then it will remove all the recipes for blocks, like iron block, copper block, gold block, and etc... (I will expand this on the future for mod machines)

			for more informations about CraftTweaker support, check out [this](https:/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fwww.reddit.com%252fr%252ffeedthebeast%252fcomments%252f7n1cg5%252funidict_112220_update%252f).

			New: a config option to blacklist some ItemStacks in Unification (resquested by [lanse505](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/members/lanse505))

			there are several other improvements on the source code, like resource gathering, but including all them here would make this changelog huge =D

			so, I guess this is the last version of UniDict... for 2017! I wish you all a Happy new year!
		UniDict-1.12.2-2.1.jar:
			1.12.2-2.1:

			 * now resource gathering is made on init (this will need some testing in order to see if there are no negative effects.). 
			 * now you can pass null values (for the shape)for the CraftTweaker command mods.unidict.api.newShapedRecipeTemplate() without crashing. 
			 * added a new "RemoveByKind" CT command, "furnace". 
			 * added the method "addItemStackToBlackList" to UniDictAPI, this will allow modders to "blacklist" ItemStacks directly (resquested by [SkySom](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/members/SkySom)) 
			 * 
			added an optional parameter "String[] resourceKindWhiteList" for the CT commands "mods.unidict.removalByKind,get("crafting")" and "mods.unidict.removalByKind,get("furnace")"
			is is basically a filter, that it will remove recipes only when the resource contains the given "kinds".

			 * changed how to use the "RemovalByKind" CT Command

			now it is needed to "get" the wanted "RemovalByKind".
			usage:
			"val removalByKind = mods.unidict.removalByKind.get("removalByKindName")""
			it will return the wanted "RemovalByKind" instance, as long you passed it a valid value.
			currently the valid values are ("crafting", "furnace")
			(probably I will have to create a "wiki" to explain better these things XD)

			added another "RemovalByKind", the "furnace"
