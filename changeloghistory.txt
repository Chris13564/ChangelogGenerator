Enigmatica 2: Expert 1.32:
	Minor Update
	Downgraded AE2 to the latest release.
	Updated Thaumcraft to BETA17.

Enigmatica 2: Expert 1.31:
	Remember to run both update commands

	 * ”/bqs_loot default load” and “/bq_admin default load”
	 * Removed Angel of Vengeance
	 * Removed Scaling Health
	AoV and Scaling Health were originally put in the pack to add a sense of increased PvE difficulty, and make handling threats more fun and versatile. I no longer feel like they fulfill this purpose, as AoV is mostly used for cheesing bosses, and Scaling Health mostly just means you’ll have to hit mobs a few additional times

	Added

	Tweaks

	 * Cyclic: Re-enabled Hearts
	 * Dark Utilities: Charms can now go in any Bauble slot
	 * Ice&Fire: Re-configured, as the config file was renamed and reset to default by an update
	 * Modular Machinery: Changed all Machine multiblocks to require both in and output. You may need to swap the placement of your item in and outputs.
	 * Morph-O-Tool: Changed to morph when held in main hand
	Recipes

	 * Creative: Gas Tank Frame & Master Trophy can now be seen in JEI
	 * Gear: Wooden Gear x2 recipe removed

Enigmatica 2: Expert 1.29:
	I apologize for the massive instability in the modpack in the recent updates, I’m doing my best to stabilize the pack, without losing out on updates and new content.

	 * And probably a lot more that I'm forgetting, no new content however.
