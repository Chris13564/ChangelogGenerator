Enigmatica 2: Expert 1.18 to Enigmatica 2: Expert 1.32

Enigmatica 2: Expert 1.32:
	Minor Update
	Downgraded AE2 to the latest release.
	Updated Thaumcraft to BETA17.

Enigmatica 2: Expert 1.31:
	Remember to run both update commands

	 * ”/bqs_loot default load” and “/bq_admin default load”
	 * Removed Angel of Vengeance
	 * Removed Scaling Health
	AoV and Scaling Health were originally put in the pack to add a sense of increased PvE difficulty, and make handling threats more fun and versatile. I no longer feel like they fulfill this purpose, as AoV is mostly used for cheesing bosses, and Scaling Health mostly just means you’ll have to hit mobs a few additional times
